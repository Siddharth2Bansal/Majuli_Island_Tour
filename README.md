# Majuli_Island_Tour

## Introduction
This is a 3D VR tour of the Majuli Island district made during the course CS 346 at IITG. This tour is made with the intention of preserving the beauty of the island and to promote tourism.
The island is home to many of the cultural traditions and practices of the Assamese communities but is slowly sinking into the water. Thus, it is very important to preserve its beauty and culture.
## Features
- The tour is made using 300+ 3D images and 360-degree videos.
- Maps of the different areas on the island are available at each site to allow easy navigation and teleportation for the user. An island-wide map is also available.
- To add immersion, background audio is available at every site.
- Info pads are available at various locations to get additional information about the places.
- The tour is made using Unity and C# scripts and is made for Oculus Rift.
